This notebook uses supervised machine learning model to classify data and train on the alzheimer's disease data.

Our findings demonstrate that by analyzing MRI scans, machine learning models can accurately identify patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
This is a significant development, as early detection of the disease can result in early interventions and better outcomes for patients.


The study concludes that machine learning algorithms have the potential to provide an accurate and efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using MRI data. Further research is needed to optimize the use of machine learning algorithms for clinical applications.
