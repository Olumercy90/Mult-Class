This notebook uses supervised machine learning model to classify data and train on the alzheimer's disease data.

Our findings demonstrate that by analyzing MRI scans, machine learning models can accurately identify patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
This is a significant development, as early detection of the disease can result in early interventions and better outcomes for patients.
